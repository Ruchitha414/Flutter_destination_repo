# Flutter → React Agent — Destination Repository
 
This repository is the **destination repo** for the **Flutter-to-React Agent**.  

It stores **finalized build artifacts**, **transformed React bundles**, and **deployment packages** produced by the agent pipeline.  

Source code and transformation logic live in the source/agent repo; **only release outputs** live here.
